NAME
    Data::Dump::Color - Like Data::Dump, but with color

VERSION
    version 0.20

SYNOPSIS
    Use it like you would Data::Dump, e.g.:

     use Data::Dump::Color; dd localtime;

DESCRIPTION
    This module aims to be a drop-in replacement for Data::Dump. It adds
    colors to dumps. For more information, see Data::Dump. This
    documentation explains what's different between this module and
    Data::Dump.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported by default, but they are exportable.

RESULTS
    By default Data::Dump::Color shows array indexes or hash pair sequence
    in comments for visual aid, e.g.:

     [
       "this",      # [0]
       "is",        # [1]
       "a",         # [2]
       "5-element", # [3]
       "array",     # [4]
       {
         0  => "with",  # .{0}
         1  => "an",    # .{1}
         2  => "extra", # .{2}
         3  => "hash",  # .{3}
         4  => "at",    # .{4}
         5  => "the",   # .{5}
         16 => "end",   # .{6}
       },           # [5]
     ]

    "[]" and "{}" brackets will indicate whether they are indexes to an
    array or a hash. The dot prefixes will mark depth level.

    To turn this off, set $INDEX to 0:

     [
       "this",
       "is",
       "a",
       "5-element",
       "array",
       {
         0  => "with",
         1  => "an",
         2  => "extra",
         3  => "hash",
         4  => "at",
         5  => "the",
         16 => "end",
       },
     ]

VARIABLES
    "$Data::Dump::*" package variables from Data::Dump, like
    $Data::Dump::TRY_BASE64, etc are now in the "Data::Dump::Color"
    namespace, e.g. $Data::Dump::Color::TRY_BASE64, etc.

    Additional variables include:

    $COLOR => BOOL (default: undef)
        Whether to force-enable or disable color. If unset, color output
        will be determined from $ENV{COLOR} or when in interactive terminal
        (when "-t STDOUT" is true).

    %COLORS => HASH (default: default colors)
        Define colors.

    $INDEX => BOOL (default: 1)
        Whether to add array/hash index visual aid.

ENVIRONMENT
    *   COLOR

        If set, then will force color output on or off. By default, will
        only output color when in interactive terminal. This is consulted
        when $COLOR is not set.

FAQ
  How do I turn off index comments?
    Set $Data::Dump::Color::INDEX to 0.

  How do I turn off colors?
    Well, colors is sort of the point of this module. But if you want to
    turn it off, you can set environment COLOR to 0, or
    $Data::Dump::Color::COLOR to 0.

  How do I customize colors?
    Fiddle the colors in %Data::Dump::Color::COLORS. There will probably be
    proper color theme support in the future (based on
    SHARYANTO::Role::ColorTheme.
