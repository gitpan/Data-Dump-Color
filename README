NAME
    Data::Dump::Color - Data::Dump, but with color

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Dump::Color;
     dd(...);

DESCRIPTION
    WARNING: This is purely a proof-of-concept release.

    Data::Dump::Color is a drop-in replacement for Data::Dump, but dumps
    with color when output is terminal. The goal is producing pretty dumps
    that are nice to look at. Data::Dump is a nice basis since its dumps are
    already quite pretty (vertically aligned, etc).

    Aside from color, there are a couple of niceties too like adding
    comments containing array indices and total number of hash pairs.

FUNCTIONS
  dd(...)
    Dump one or more data structures.

TODO
    *   Color themes, including ones that support 256 colors.
